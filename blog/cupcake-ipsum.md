# Fishing.Life?

<p>Fishing.Life is about my journey pursuing my hobby of inshore saltwater fishing and content creation. I've caught a lot of firsts, as you'll see, but I haven't quite been able to "dial in" any specific species. This blog is somewhat of a result of that frustration. I started Fishing.Life so that I had a place to keep all of my notes, pictures, and videos and be able to share them with others. I needed a place to store my memories. I'm a web application developer and everything lasts forever on the internet so, an online blog was the obvious choice. These memories can also serve you on your fishing journey. Learn by my mistakes instead of your own, saving you valuable time, money, and disappointment. I even encourage you contact me if you want to save me a mistake! I just want everybody to catch fish. There will be gear reviews and spot dissections, big fish and bigger fails, and plenty of fishing stories. I even tell you exactly where I was fishing.</p>

<p>If you're still reading, you probably want to catch more fish like I do, or you appreciate a well told fishing story. Either way, I hope to surpass your expectations. Hopefully my mistakes can save you some disappointment and my wins can spill over to you. Maybe I'll even see you out the flats one day. If I've got your interest, don't forget to head down to the footer and reach out to me on social media. Then finish reading this post if you'd like to know more about Fishing.Life.</p>

## In the beginning

<p>I fished my family's two small ponds when I was growing up on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia. It had bluegill trained on hotdogs, catfish big enough to eat a whole slice of bread in one bite, and largemouth bass up to about two pounds. It was nothing special, and I could do it whenever I wanted. I quickly became bored with fishing and by the time I was in my teens I didn't fish at all. Fast forward until recently, I'm thirty-ish, married with children, and on a trip to a Dauphin Island, Alabama beach house. My son and I decide on a whim that we should go on an offshore fishing charter while we are there! Best. Idea. Ever. We booked a four hour trip with (TODO: insert charter link here). It was red snapper season. Need I say more? I didn't know it then, but boy was I in for the best awakening into saltwater fishing.</p>

<p>Our ride out was awesome. I'd guess that it was about an hours worth of dual 300 Evinrudes pushing a 24 footer, you do that math and tell me the distance we were out. We were over a wreck in about 75 feet of water, using Penn Squall 30's. We were using knocker rigs with what looked like a 6 oz egg weight and a 4/0 or 5/0 circle hook. I have no idea what weight class the rod was, nor did I know the test of the mono that the reel was spooled with. If I had to guess, I'd say it was a 6ft 50-80 lb class rod and the Squall was spooled with 50lb test monofilament. For bait we were using thawed pogies hooked through the eyes. We let the bait drop for a ten second count and hung on. It was instant action! My son and I caught a limit and I caught the fishing fever.</p>

### The splurge

<p>With fishing fever in full effect, I did what anyone with that sickness would do. I started purchasing lots of gear. I less than a years time, I had amassed a small collection of rods, reels, and tackle. Here is the a current list of all of my rods and reels. I won't list all of the tackle, but I do go over that in my planning and fishing blogs in detail. Every trip you'll know exactly where I fished, the tides, wind, water temp, baits, rigs, and rather or not I was in a kayak, SUP, boat or on foot.</p>

### Right gear, no fish...

<p>I didn't buy all of this gear at once. It was a progressive thing that took about a year. I would buy new gear when I wanted to target a different species. It was during this time that I caught my first of a lot of different species. Spanish mackerel, gag grouper, snook, redfish, mangrove snapper, black drum, whiting, and pompano. I'm still hunting for my first tarpon! From watching others at the beach or on YouTube I learned to target each of those species, but it was always hit or miss. I was still getting most fishing trips. It goes without saying, when you spend lots of money on rods and reels and you're not catching fish, it's pretty frustrating. It was time to change something up.</p>

### Time to make a plan

<p>I started making notes about when I caught fish and when I got skunked. I noted the weather, the tide, the current, the water temperature, the depth, the structure, the lures, the leader, the retrieve speed. I wrote down everything you could think of, and I did it every time I fished. I realized that I couldn't make sense of much of it, and it was so difficult to keep up with. It's not the easiest thing to be on an SUP and take notes while zipping on the current near John's Pass, more on that in a future post. Even with all of those notes, I still couldn't figure out the patterns of all of these different game fish. I started looking for help, and that's when I found [SaltStrong](www.saltstrong.com "SaltStrong.com"). If you're reading this, I'm sure you heard of them, it was a game changer for me, but not an instant one. They taught me how to plan a fishing trip. The 20-30% discounts on top notch fishing gear and tackle is pretty killer too.</p>

<p>Now armed with an entire community of like minded anglers, I surely couldn't get skunked, right? Wrong! I still get skunked, but it is less often, and usually due to poor planning on my part. With the [SaltStrong](www.saltstrong.com "SaltStrong.com") benefits, not planning enough is totally on me. I hope that this blog will hold me more accountable to my plans, because they will be blogged as well, rather it be a piss poor plan or a good one.</p>

## Where do I want Fishing.Life to go?

<p>So that's what we will do. Pick a day to go fishing and what fish to target based on trends analysis by the [SaltStrong](www.saltstrong.com "SaltStrong.com") community's awesome tools, pick some spots based on that, fish, then blog about it! Seriously, I just want everyone to catch more fish. I have so much fun rather by myself or with friends and family, but so much more fun we we all catch fish together. If this small blog of mine grows into something larger, then cool, but if not, I'm happy just blogging. It gives me a chance to flex the creative muscles that I've long neglected. So rather it's Captain Michael's Fishing.Life charters, the Fishing.Life guy on YouTube, or just still fishing, I'll be satisfied.</p>

## Conclusion

* come on the journey
* remember why I started
* remind readers why they want to read
* envision where we want to go

<p>I started this to store memories and to help me and anyone who reads along to catch more fish. If catching more fish sounds good to you or if you just like reading a good fish story, I hope you will join me on future posts and fishing adventures. You've already read this far, right?.</p>
