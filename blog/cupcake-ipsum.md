# Fishing.Life? 

Fishing.Life is about my journey pursuing my hobby of inshore saltwater fishing. I've caught a lot of firsts, as you'll see below, but I haven't quite been able to "dial in" any specific species. That proved frustrating to me. This blog is part of the result. I started Fishing.Life so that I had a place to keep all of my notes, pictures, and videos. I needed a place to store my memories. I'm a web application developer and everything lasts forever on the internet so, here we are. These memories can also serve you on your fishing journey. Learn by my mistakes instead of your own, saving you valuable time, money, and disappointment. You can even contact me if you want to save me a mistake! I just want everybody to catch fish.

## In the beginning

I fished my families two small ponds when I was growing up on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia. It had bluegill trained on hotdogs, catfish big enough to eat a whole slice of bread in one bite, and largemouth bass up to about two pounds. It was nothing special, and I could do it whenever I wanted. I quickly became bored with fishing and by the time I was in my teens I didn't fish at all. Fast forward now until I'm 30ish, married with children, and on a trip to a Dauphin Island, Alabama beach house. My lovely wife's twin cousin's and their dad, and my son and I decide we should go on an offshore fishing charter! Best. Idea. Ever.

It was red snapper season. Need I say more? I didn't know it then, but boy was I in for the best rude awakening into saltwater fishing.
