# Fishing.Life?

    Fishing.Life is about my journey pursuing my hobby of inshore saltwater fishing. I've caught a lot of firsts, as you'll see below, but I haven't quite been able to "dial in" any specific species. That proved frustrating to me. This blog is part of the result. I started Fishing.Life so that I had a place to keep all of my notes, pictures, and videos. I needed a place to store my memories. I'm a web application developer and everything lasts forever on the internet so, here we are. These memories can also serve you on your fishing journey. Learn by my mistakes instead of your own, saving you valuable time, money, and disappointment. You can even contact me if you want to save me a mistake! I just want everybody to catch fish.

## In the beginning

    I fished my families two small ponds when I was growing up on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia. It had bluegill trained on hotdogs, catfish big enough to eat a whole slice of bread in one bite, and largemouth bass up to about two pounds. It was nothing special, and I could do it whenever I wanted. I quickly became bored with fishing and by the time I was in my teens I didn't fish at all. Fast forward now until I'm 30ish, married with children, and on a trip to a Dauphin Island, Alabama beach house. My son and I decide on a whim that we should go on an offshore fishing charter! Best. Idea. Ever. We booked a four hour trip with \[TODO: insert charter link here\]. It was red snapper season. Need I say more? I didn't know it then, but boy was I in for the best rude awakening into saltwater fishing.

    Our ride out was awesome. I'd guess that it was about an hours worth of dual 300 Evinrudes pushing a 24 footer, you do that math. We were over a wreck in about 75 feet of water, the four of us using Penn Squall 30's with knocker rigs. I didn't know by looking, at least not then, but we were using knocker rigs with what looked like a 6 oz egg weight and a 4/0 or 5/0 circle hook. I have no idea what weight class the rod was, nor did I know the test of the mono that the reel was spooled with. If I had to guess, I'd guess it was a 6ft 50-80lb class rod with 50lb test. For bait we were using thawed pogies hooked through the eye. We let the bait drop for a ten second count and hung on. It was instant action! My son, with the help of the deckhand, and I caught a limit and the fishing fever.
